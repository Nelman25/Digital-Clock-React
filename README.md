# React Digital Clock
This is a simple digital clock application built with React JS.

This simple project was created for practicing React Hooks, specifically _useState_ and _useEffect_. It serves as a basic example of how to manage state and manipulate the DOM using these hooks.

The application utilizes the useState hook to manage the current time and the useEffect hook to update the time on a regular interval. The component renders the formatted time to the screen.
